#Tic Tac Toe game
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking empty cells with their designated symbols, either "X" or "O," until one player achieves a winning pattern or the entire grid is filled without a winner. The goal of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols.
